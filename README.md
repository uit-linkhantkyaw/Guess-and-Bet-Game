The C++ project about two games in one program. One is Betting on a random number and the other is Guessing a country with fun clues.
You can simply download the files from codes and run in any IDE.
First, you may would need to run the Guess and Bet cpp file.
In the program, you will see the clearly described welcome message and two options in which you can choose two games.
The first game is Bet Game. 
In the game, you need to register yourself with your name and the deposit amount you want to have in your account. Don't worry, this won't take your real money and either you won't get any money from the game.
After the registeration, you will be able to choose another 3 options. These are 1.(range between 1 to 5) 2.(range between 1 to 10) 3.(range between 1 to 15). According to the difficuilty level, you will get specific winning payback percent.
While you are playing the game and after playing the game, you will be seeing your balance.
On the other hand, if you choose the second game which is "Guess the country", you will see 5 options, Asia, Europe, Africa, America and all the country option.
In this game, you can't bet but guess.
According to the option you chose, you will have to guess the random country. 
There will be clue, which shows the total word count of the country.
Another clue is that when you type a character if it is one of the character in the guessing country word, that character will automatically filled in the space even if it isn't the first character. And if there are two or more same characters in the guessing country words, they all will be filled.
After that, you will have to guess the rest of the words.
